** Automating PII Principal / Data Subject Rights and Data Controls For Computational Privacy Law **

Session Tues 6th, Oct Led By 
- Mark Lizar Open Consent Group UK & Smart Species Canada - Mission is to support International Decentralised Data Governance and Meaningful Consent
- James Hazard - CommonAccord.org  "Bringing the World to Agreement" - Mission to modularise law refine and reuse the same law - 


This is an approach to developing standard clauses using GitForLaw.  We aim to begin a clause repository collaboratively together.  It can combine with CommonAccord so that clauses can be iterated upon through application (reused rather than re-issued.)  With international transborder security and privacy rights so that all stakeholders can use the same standards to be interoperable with humans. In essence the evolution of a very old human innovation called the receipt.

## Goals:

1. Get familiar with Git and GitHub for publishing texts and collaboration.

1. Get a notion of legal text "modules" as a way of defining and sharing legal rules.

1. Explore use in privacy specification.


## Context

1. Git and Github are general purpose ways of long term collaboration.  A key part of open source collaboration for software, and should be used for legal text, too.

1. Legal rules are mostly expressed in text.  A nuanced approach to legal rules can be constructed from the top-down ideas of law and regulation, and the bottom-up ideas of contracts, licenses and consents.  This can be both highly individualized and highly interoperable if we handle text as modules.

1. Applied to privacy, there can be broad engagements such as data sharing frameworks, specific agreements such as terms of use and individualized elements such as consent receipts.  These can be instantiated in particular settings and automated using software code. 


## Agenda

1. You get on Github.

1. You draft a clause.

1. You contribute it to this repository.


## Background

This is the first hack for aNG for international policy infrastructure and is apart of a long term series of community projects that has driven the development of decentralised notice and consent standards and best practice for identity management and surveillance technology. Designed to enhance privacy policies and Terms of Use in a way that addressess the #FakePrivacy burden of policy.

This is part of a long term multi-standard community initiatives and 20 years of OECD to ISO standardisation for cross border data governance.

After a decade of standards development the next generation privacy standard for Online Notice has been published.   standard for Operational Notice & Consent Receipts has been published June 2020 (ISO 29184 with the Notice & Consent Receipt) which we can finally put to good use.

Challenge 1: Write a standard contractual clause to supersede terms of online services for Data Rights which mandate consistent control performance, consider key issues (and well know problems)


Privacy Rights - Consent Types for Master Data Controls https://openconsent.atlassian.net/l/c/Gw2dCTwL

review the Privacy rights, Consent Type and legal justification obligations and consideration

use this material to draft standard clauses for the use of privacy rights for data controls.

Publish Clause to AdvCIS or to GitHub

Objective is to make standard clauses for the International Repository - which supersede terms of service and provide data subject with master privacy data controls.

To use the newly published (and long awaited) ISO Online Privacy Notice Controls combined into the Kantara / AdvCIS: Operational Notice & Consent Receipt Specification V1.2, which provide an independent inter-national legal toolset for decentralised transparency and data control.  To put this resource to use it requires first the extra-territorial space and the formation of standardised contractual clauses as an alternative to what we have now.

  

Why an International GitLaw Repository
- The objective of this hackathon is to further international computational law by creating and working on standard privacy contract clauses for extending privacy rights for transborder data flows to contracts and terms and services. Cross legal jurisdiction and identity surveillance domains with Master Data Right Controls.
   - What will this accomplish:
   - Support international Operational Privacy Rights and Enforcement Perspective



## Git Instructions

1. Register an [account on Gitub]([https://github.com] if you dont have one already  
2. From your browser - log into Github and navigate to the model clause template. [At this link](https://github.com/CommonAccord/OPN-aNG-Accord/blob/main/ClauseTemplate.md)  ??? Clone it by clicking on the "Edit" button which will "fork" this whole OPN-aNG-Accord repo into your account and set you up to edit.
3. Edit the page - add a title (Ti=) add section text (sec=) add your name (Author=) add a Comment if you like.  Change the name of the file (in the box at the top of the page) to something meaningful.  Save (box at the bottom), with a really short note.  
4. Do a "Pull-request" - asking us to add your new file to the main repository.

## Background:

To address data governance challenges there has been a longitudinal effort to standardise guidelines for transborder flows of personal data for online identification and digital identity/surviellance management. In this regard the international standard for Online Privacy and Consent Controls is recently published - with the use of receipt standard to capture privacy records from online privacy notice and consent.

Privacy policies and terms of use that people are suppose to read and learn have been callled out as the Biggest Lie on The Internet, where services pretend to get consent (to policies no one can read or track).  Without notice and consent standards there is very weak transparency online which is now a severe data breach of the most sensitive kinds in many societies.  An industry now dogged by  movies like "terms and conditions may apply", "the greatest hack", and the "social dilemma" these policies and terms are contracts of adhesion dressed up as consent. Dependent on the Terms of Use of the device manufacturer, the browser and the law.  Policies Without transparent security, strong (or better legal transparency), meaningful notice and proportional use of rights are just not trustworhty.

Trustwothiness in created by knowing what to expect. 

## Key Points Standard Clause should be aware of

Surveillance by Design - Online surveillance dark patterns in consent and notice put people at risk of harms in an increasing number of ways as the power of big data technology grows. These dark patterns, also known as surveillance by design makes explicit consent for special/sensitive data categories low quality. Especially if consent is 100% dependent on online privacy Notice.

Strong transparency is missing for digital services - little transparency over the legal entities and privacy risks and

Key Risks over the use of Digital Identity Management

### Meta-Data - Identifier Management Transparency (IMT) this is critical component of any clause. (e.g. restricting identification or identifiers tracking, cross-site profiling, with cookies and beacons. Especially for data trusts like parental consent, or for medical research, etc which require consent by design, where metadata and big data is a human resource (not a capitalistic one)

### Secondary Use

Surveillance before explicit consent to surveillance (when consent is lawfully required) is not meaningful consent and is un-trustworthy. In most contexts this is considered a breach of security as notice and consent is required for lawful data processing (with some exceptions)
Secondary Use of Data - for example - context based advertising - without context based privacy safeguards - write a privacy agreement clause for restricting secondary use of data for advertising

Transparency over 3rd Party disclosures and beneficial owners of data processing (e.g. 2nd party Controller or 3rd party is explicit) are provided with a short linked notice receipt to the original Notice for a record of data processing.

Core example: For data trusts or self sovereign - master data control management the meta-data and big data benefits are under a fiduciary trust. (like children's education records), Privacy information should be automatically sourced, meta-data, secondary use of data, the source of the data and data inferred produced by the system.
